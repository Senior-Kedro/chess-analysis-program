# chess-analysis-program
This repository contains a program for analysing positions on a chessboard. The task of the program is to determine which pieces are under attack and identify potential threats to them. For the convenience of entering the initial state of the game, the ability to load the positions of the pieces from a file is implemented.

Main features:
Data structure:

An efficient data structure for encoding the location of chess pieces has been developed.
Analysis algorithm:

An algorithm has been created that determines which pieces are under attack and determines from whom they are threatened.
Input from a file:

The ability to enter the initial location of the pieces from a file has been implemented for the convenience of the user.
